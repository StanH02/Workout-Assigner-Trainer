# Trainer Workout Plan - Composition Example

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that demonstrates **composition** in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

- How to define classes and objects in Python
- The difference between inheritance and composition
- How one class can contain an object of another class (has-a relationship)
- How to organize and link class logic across multiple roles like `Trainer` and `WorkoutPlan`

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

- `WorkoutPlan` is a class that holds the type of workout
- `Trainer` is a class that receives a name and a workout plan
- We create multiple plans and assign them to different trainers

## ðŸ§ª Output Example
- Trainer Stan assigned this plan:
- Workout Plan: Full-body strength training
